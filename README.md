# Software Design Patterns

This is a collection of Findings and case studies of Software and Object Oriented Programming design patterns.

I'm building this repository just as study notes for myself. The language of choice is Typescript.

## Document Structure

Each pattern has its own folder with a `md` description file and some other `ts` files with implementation details. The document structure is as it follows:

* _Pattern Name and Classification_: Name and family of the pattern (must include aliases).
* _Intent_: What the pattern addresses.
* _Scenario_: A real problem showcasing how the pattern solves the issue.
* _Applicability_: Situations that are best suited for this pattern to work.
* _Structure_: Graphical representation of the pattern.
* _Participants_: The classes and/or objects participating in the design pattern and their responsibilities.
* _Collaborations_: How the participants collaborate to carry out their responsibilities.
* _Consequences_: Trade-offs and results of implementing a pattern.
* _Implementation_: Tips and tricks when implementing the pattern.
* _Sample Code_: Link to `ts` files with sample code.
* _Known Uses_: Examples of the pattern found in real systems.
* _Related Patterns_: What design patterns are closely related to this one? What are the important differences? With which other patterns should this one be used?
