# Software Design Patterns

This is a collection of Findings and case studies of Software and Object Oriented Programming design patterns.

I'm building this repository just as study notes for myself. The language of choice is Typescript.

## Document Structure

Each pattern has its own folder with a `md` description file and some other `ts` files with implementation details. The document structure is as it follows:

* __Pattern Name and Classification__: Name and family of the pattern (must include aliases).
* __Intent__: What the pattern addresses.
* __Scenario__: A real problem showcasing how the pattern solves the issue.
* __Applicability__: Situations that are best suited for this pattern to work.
* __Structure__: Graphical representation of the pattern.
* __Participants__: The classes and/or objects participating in the design pattern and their responsibilities.
* __Collaborations__: How the participants collaborate to carry out their responsibilities.
* __Consequences__: Trade-offs and results of implementing a pattern.
* __Implementation__: Tips and tricks when implementing the pattern.
* __Sample Code__: Link to `ts` files with sample code.
* __Known Uses__: Examples of the pattern found in real systems.
* __Related Patterns__: What design patterns are closely related to this one? What are the important differences? With which other patterns should this one be used?
